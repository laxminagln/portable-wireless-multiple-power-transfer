This project presents a wireless portable charger which on charging can be carried on  daily journey and 
can be used to charge multiple devices at the same time. Usual wireless chargers are also portable but as
the word ‘portable’ means that it is pre-charged and can be carried with the easiness of a power bank. 
The objective of the project is to charge at least three devices. From the usual wireless charger, it is 
different that it need not be supplied with AC source at the time of charging, and it can supply to more 
devices at the same time.
A wireless charging base must be constructed with a battery embedded in it using the principle of inductive 
power transfer. Wireless charging module should be built such that it can store charge from the AC supply 
provided. Multiple charging circuits could be powered with the help of principle of Electromagnetic Induction.

AC TO DC CONVERTER-->BATTERY CHARGER CIRCUIT-->INVERTER-->IPT TRANSMITTER
This is transmitter part of the circuit.

IPT RECEIVER-->CHARGING CIRCUITS-->DEVICES
This is the receiver part of the circuit.

It is possible to make a portable wireless charger by making several modifications to its circuit and we 
can charge more than one device at a time according to the power requirement of connected device.
