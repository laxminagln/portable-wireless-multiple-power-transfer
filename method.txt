To implement the project, the required power output obtained from the receiver side must be found. 
Since mobile phones are being charged, 6W of power is required from the receiver side. The proposed 
design is to charge 3 mobile phones as an example. Therefore, 18W is required. After that a transm-
-itter which also will give a power of 18W from the supply of 220V inverter supply or simply from 
12V, 1.5A DC source has to be designed. According to the design of transmitter an inverter or just 
a battery circuit with a transistor suitable for making oscillations must be built. For powering the 
battery circuit, an AC to DC converter is constructed, called rectifier which changes from 220V AC 
to 12V DC.
1.	Design and setup AC to DC converter
The Supply voltage is 220V AC.  A stepdown Transformer is used. The transformer transforms the input 
voltage of 220V AC to 12V AC. A bridge Rectifier circuit is used to convert AC to DC. The voltage is 
then regulated to 12V by 7812 regulators.

2.	Design and setup Battery Charger
Three rechargeable batteries of 3.7V each are chosen so that on connecting them in series approximately 
12V is obtained. This bunch is charged from the rectifier supply. This is then discharged to the Trans-
-mitter part of the circuit.

3.	Setup of Transmitter Coil.
A transmitter coil must constitute Transistor coils and Resistor. The Transistor chosen is 2N222A Trans-
-istor. It is chosen because it helps in oscillations and low power amplifications. The receiver coil is 
placed in the vicinity of the Transmitter coil.

4.	Setup of Receiver Coil.
To receive power from the transmitter, receiver coil must have a capacitor, diode and coils. Capacitors 
suitable for the operation is 100 uF. 1N4007 Diode and coils are used. The cellphone battery is connected 
to this receiver coil, which charges the mobile battery.
