Project requires several circuit parts like Rectifier, Batteries, Inverter, Transmitter coils, 
Receiver coils, Charger circuits, mobile phone batteries. The constraints that we have figured 
are :
	Increasing the power transferred by transmitter.
	Increasing the distance between transmitter and receiver.
	Transferring power from transmitter to multiple receiver coils.

AC TO AC CONVERTER
First part of the circuit. The transformer transforms the input voltage of 220V AC to 12V AC. 
This is converted to DC by the bridge rectifier connected. The voltage is regulated to 12V by 
7812 regulators.

BATTERY CHARGER
3 Rechargeable batteries of 3.7V are connected in series to get 12V. This bunch is charged 
from the rectifier supply. This discharges to the transmitter part of the circuit.

IPT TRANSMITTER
This constitutes 2N2222A transistor, coils, resistor. The transistor helps in oscillations 
and low power amplification. The receiver coil is placed near the transmitter coil [above 
or at a lesser distance between them].

IPT RECEIVER
Receiver coil has a 100uF capacitor, 1N4007 diode and coils. This receives power from the 
transmitter. The cell phone battery is connected to the receiver, thus getting it charged.
